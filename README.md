# Uncommon Assembly Language Bugs

This repository demonstrates some uncommon but potentially problematic errors that can occur in assembly language programming. These errors often relate to subtle issues with pointer arithmetic, stack management, and function calls, which can be difficult to debug.

The examples provided highlight how seemingly simple instructions can cause unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. The solutions demonstrate ways to correct these errors and avoid similar problems in the future.  Understanding these edge cases is crucial for writing robust and reliable assembly code.
